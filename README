# Dijkstra's Map Shortest Path Finder

## Overview
Dijkstra's Map is an efficient web-based tool that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between two selected points on a map. Designed for both educational purposes and practical use, it provides a clear visualization of the algorithm in action and can be used to plan routes effectively.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: Click to select start and end points directly on the map.
- **Path Visualization**: Watch Dijkstra's algorithm work as it explores possible paths and highlights the shortest route.
- **Distance and Time Estimates**: Get calculated estimates for distance and expected travel time between points.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various devices and screen sizes.

## Notes
In the assignment Part II, a client-server model is built. Now we are able to visualize the path between two points on a visible graph.

## How to Use
1. Go to the `server` sub-directory and enter `make` in the terminal.
2. Go back to the `soln` directory, enter `make run`, now you should be able to see a graph of the Edmonton map.
3. Click random two points on the graph, then the path will be printed to the command window and lines showing the path between two points should be visible.
4. Repeat step 3 or exit as desired.
5. If you want to rerun the program, make sure to `make clean` first then repeat steps 1-4.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Dijkstra-Map.git
cd Dijkstra-Map
