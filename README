Dijkstra's Map Shortest Path Finder
Overview
Dijkstra's Map is an efficient web-based tool that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between two selected points on a map. Designed for both educational purposes and practical use, it provides a clear visualization of the algorithm in action and can be used to plan routes effectively.

Features
Interactive Map: Click to select start and end points directly on the map.
Path Visualization: Watch Dijkstra's algorithm work as it explores possible paths and highlights the shortest route.
Distance and Time Estimates: Get calculated estimates for distance and expected travel time between points.
Responsive Design: Compatible with various devices and screen sizes.

Notes:
In the assignment PartII, a client-server model is built. Now we are able to visualize the path between 2 points on a visible graph.

How to use:
1. Go to sub-directory in server and enter make in the terminal
2. Go back to the soln directory, enter make run, now you should be able to see a graph of edmonton map
3. click random 2 points on the graph, then the path will be printed to the command window and we should be able to see lines showing the path between 2 points
4. repeat step 3 or exit
5. if want to rerun the program, make sure to make clean first then repeat step 1- 4

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/username/Dijkstra-Map.git
cd Dijkstra-Map
